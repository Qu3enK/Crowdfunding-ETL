## Purpose
The purpose of the Crowdfunding-ETL repository is to assist Independent Funding with moving all their accessible data from one large Excel file onto a PostgreSQL database. This way, the analytics team will be able to perform analysis and create reports for company stakeholders as well as individuals who donate to projects. [^1]

The analysis of the Crowdfunding-ETL data yields the following:
- There are 8,175 Backers across 14 'live' campaigns.
- The 14 campaigns have a remaining total of $736,394 of goal amount.
- The Backers have a total remaining campaign goal amount of $441,174,261.

## Conclusion
The 14 Live campaigns are doing really well. Emails to the Backer should be sent ahead of the deadline to ensure the Backers have adequate time to respond and contribute to their specific campaigns. In addition, this will assist in the Company reaching thier campaign goal.
